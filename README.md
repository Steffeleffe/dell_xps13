# Linux on a Dell XPS 13 (touch screen)

This is my guide on how I have set up my Dell XPS 13 (5690).

## What Linux distro to choose?

After booting a few distros up via USB stick, I realized that most desktop environments don't like the HiDPI display on the XPS 13 (resolution is QHD+ at 3200x1800).

### Cinnamon (Linux Mint)

Right now looking at Linux Mint Cinnamon which works much out of the box.

### Gnome 3 (Ubuntu)

Latest Ubuntu has Gnome 3.26 which should handle HiDPI okay as well.
